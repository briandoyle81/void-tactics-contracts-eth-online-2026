// directly, so a single shipId space can resolve against two different
// backing stores: Ships.sol (real ERC-721 human ships) and AIShips.sol
// (pooled, non-NFT AI ships). Dispatch is purely numeric — any id at or
// above AI_SHIP_ID_OFFSET belongs to AIShips.sol, everything below belongs
// to Ships.sol — so Game.sol needs no source changes at all, only a
// constructor argument pointed here instead of at Ships.sol.
//
// setTimestampDestroyed is the one function that needs real orchestration:
// Ships.sol used to mark the destroyed ship, credit the destroyer, and pay
// the DEC/UTC reward all by indexing into its own storage for both ships.
// Once AI ships can live in a different contract than their destroyer (or
// vice versa), that combined logic has to live here instead, uniformly for
// both the pure-PvP case (both ids human) and the cross-contract case.
