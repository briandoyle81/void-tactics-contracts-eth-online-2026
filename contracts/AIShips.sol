// Non-NFT store for single-player AI ships, sitting behind ShipsRouter.
// AI ships are never owned or traded by players, so there's no ERC-721
// here — just Ship structs keyed by id, backed by a self-expanding
// free-list pool instead of minting a fresh token every match: allocateShip
// reuses a released slot when one is available (growing slotCount only when
// the pool is empty), and releaseShips returns a game's full AI roster to
// the pool once, at game end (see SinglePlayerMatch.onGameEnded) — never
// per-ship-destroyed mid-match, so a slot is never touched while its game
// is still resolving.
//
// Ids are offset into a range disjoint from Ships.sol's own id space so
// ShipsRouter can tell, from the numeric id alone, which backing contract
// to call. 2**40 (~1.1T) is comfortably past any realistic Ships.sol
// token-id count while staying ~8,192x under Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
// (2**53-1) — frontend code that treats ids as JS numbers (rather than
// bigint) needs this to stay exact; a symbolic value like 2**128 (this
// used before) silently breaks that.
