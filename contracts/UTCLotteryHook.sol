// UTCLotteryHook — the pool + lottery half of the Uniswap pick
// (docs/eth-global-remote-strategy-v2.md, Pick 3). No fee-to-treasury, no
// active peg defense — both were considered and rejected on their own
// merits (see the strategy doc). This hook does exactly one thing: every
// UTC->native ("sell") swap on the one pool it's bound to earns the seller
// weighted entry into a periodic drawing for a prize ship, funded by nothing
// but chance — no funds are taken, no swap economics are altered.
//
// Direction: currency0 is always the native token (Currency.wrap(address(0))
// sorts below every real token address per CurrencyLibrary's convention), so
// `!params.zeroForOne` unambiguously means "trader is providing UTC to the
// pool" — a sell. This is deliberately the *only* direction that earns
// entries: it's also exactly the trade direction that already defends the
// existing passive mint-arbitrage price ceiling (ShipPurchaser.tierPrices),
// so this reinforces that mechanic instead of competing with it, and does
// nothing for the (intentionally undefended) floor.
//
// Single-pool lock: a hook address is permissionless to reference from *any*
// pool someone else creates, not just the one this project intends — an
// attacker could otherwise point a throwaway pool (two tokens they fully
// control) at this same hook address and farm lottery entries for free,
// completely decoupled from real UTC/ETH activity. beforeInitialize is
// implemented purely to close that: it locks onto the first pool that
// initializes with this hook (and only if its currencies actually match the
// configured UTC/native pair), and reverts every later initialize attempt
// for any other pool. afterSwap independently re-checks the pool id anyway —
// cheap, and makes the invariant explicit at the point it actually matters.
