// Pluggable win effect (see IWinEffect.sol): raises every surviving roster
// ship's HP up to healToPercent% of its max hull points, same "never heal
// a ship down" floor semantics as RoguelikeNodeMap.campaignAutoHealPercent
// (which RoguelikeMatch always applies first, unconditionally, before this
// or any other win effect runs) — this just lets a specific node push that
// floor higher than the campaign-wide default, e.g. a reward node that
// fully heals on top of a campaign's ordinary partial auto-heal. Needs
// RoguelikeRun.setIsAllowedToModifyRuns(address(this), true) — deploy-time
// wiring, not this contract's concern. Roguelike-specific in practice
// (reads RoguelikeRun's roster) even though the interface is generic — if
// triggered from PvP/Tournament, where the player has no active roguelike
// run, getRun returns an empty roster and the loop below is simply a
// harmless no-op, not a revert; it's just not a meaningful effect to
// configure outside roguelike.
//
// onWin is gated behind its own isAllowedToTrigger allowlist — see
// DECBonusWinEffect.sol's matching comment on why.
