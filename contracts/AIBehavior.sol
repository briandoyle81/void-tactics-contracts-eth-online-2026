// Shared toolbox for the AI turn-decision engine: targeting, stepping,
// scoring-tile and per-archetype rule primitives. Every function here is
// internal/pure/view (no storage writes), so this compiles as a plain
// internal Solidity library — inlined into each contract that uses it, no
// separate deployment/delegatecall needed (unlike SpecialEffectsLib.sol,
// which needs external+storage because it writes game state; this only
// ever reads and returns a decision).
//
// Which tree a ship actually follows is NOT decided here. Each variant
// (faction) has its own AI contract (Variant1AI, Variant2AI, ...) that
// composes its decision trees from these primitives using what it knows
// about its own faction — e.g. that healing is an equipped special, or that
// every ship has a repair action but no ram. AIBehaviorRegistry maps
// variant -> that contract, so a faction's AI can be replaced or upgraded
// without redeploying the match contracts that call it.
//
// Design constraint: every decision here is paid for in gas by the human
// player triggering takeAITurn, and Solidity has no real search/pathfinding
// primitives. So this is deliberately a cheap ordered priority-list per
// archetype (check a primitive, act or fall through) rather than anything
// resembling enumerate-and-score optimization. Movement ("step toward"/
// "step away") is greedy axis-priority stepping toward/away from a single
// target point, not pathfinding — it ignores obstacles/other ships, the
// same simplification the original v0 script already had. SinglePlayerMatch
// wraps each ship's actual moveShip call in try/catch specifically to
// absorb the rare case this produces an illegal move (e.g. stepping onto an
// occupied cell) rather than reverting the whole turn.
