Usage:
  ./ignition-deploy-retry.sh --network <network-name> [--deploy-script <path/to/Module.ts>]

If --deploy-script is omitted, every module in ignition/modules/*.ts is deployed
(in alphabetical order), each with its own retry loop. Paths are resolved from
the repo root.

Options:
  --deploy-script <p> Deploy a single module. If omitted, deploy all modules.
  --skip-verify        Do not pass `--verify` to hardhat ignition deploy
  --no-auto-confirm   Do not auto-answer "y" to any deploy confirmation prompts
  --sleep-seconds <n> Sleep seconds between retries on transient errors (see retry conditions below)

Environment variables:
  LOG_FILE            Log file to write (default: ignition_deploy_retry.log)
  SLEEP_SECONDS      Sleep seconds between retries (default: 5)

RPC-provider-outage retries ("no backend is currently healthy to serve
traffic", seen against base-sepolia's public RPC endpoint under load) use
their own exponential backoff instead of --sleep-seconds: 5s, 10s, 20s,
40s... doubling each retry, stopping (rather than actually waiting) once
the next wait would exceed 3 minutes. Every other known-transient error
(nonce mismatch, IGN411, underpriced gas) keeps retrying at the fixed
--sleep-seconds interval with no limit, unchanged.

Safety check: for any --network other than "hardhat"/"localhost", this
script refuses to run at all unless ignition/modules/DeployAndConfig.ts has
`const PRODUCTION = true;` -- that flag gates real-deploy-only setup (e.g.
transferring contract ownership away from the deployer), defaults to false
so test fixtures work, and is easy to forget to flip before a real deploy.
