# Void Tactics — Tokenomics / Economy Audit

_Created 2026-09-16._ Scope: economic soundness of value-flow paths (UTC/UniversalCredits
minting and burning, DEC rewards, FLOW pricing, referral payouts, fee splits, the UTC/FLOW
peg) — assuming a maximally hostile, profit-seeking actor. The question throughout isn't "can
they break the game," it's "can they mint, extract, or farm more real value than they
legitimately put in." This is a different lens from the correctness/security audits in
`docs/pre-audit.md`/`docs/audit-2.md` (all HA2-*/HA3-* findings there are fixed) and the pure
gas-cost audit in `docs/gas-audit.md` — findings here are new, not duplicates of either.

This is audit-only, matching this project's established workflow: findings are recorded here,
not implemented, until the project owner picks one to fix. No `.sol` files were changed while
writing this doc. Findings use an `ECON-XX` prefix (distinct from Tournament.sol's own internal
`T-0X` code comments, which refer to already-implemented features, not audit findings) and the
same strikethrough-on-fix convention as the other audit docs.

Two parallel passes fed this doc: one on minting/reward paths (UniversalCredits, ShipPurchaser,
Ships.sol's purchase/referral/recycle flow, DestroyRewardLib, win-effect reward contracts,
FreeShipClaim/TutorialClaim), one on pricing/fee mechanisms (DroneYard, Tournament's prize
split, Lobbies' fee logic, UTCLotteryHook's entry-qualifying mechanism, VariantPurchaseGate,
ShipAttributes' cost versioning). ECON-01 was independently re-verified against current source
line-by-line before its initial write-up, including a full worked numeric trace and an on-chain
proof-of-concept (`test/ECON01_PoC.test.ts`) — that verification of the *mechanism* stands, even
though the original *severity conclusion* was corrected through discussion with the project
owner (see ECON-01's reassessment note below). No native token should be assumed to be any
specific chain's asset; findings below use "native token" generically.

### ECON-02 — `DroneYard._calculateCostToModify`'s Cost-Doubling Loop Has an Unreachable-in-Practice Overflow-Revert Point

**File:** `contracts/DroneYard.sol`, `_calculateCostToModify` (the `costMultiplier *= 2` loop)

Once a ship's cumulative `shipData.modified` (confirmed genuinely cumulative — `Ships.sol`
does `+= amountModified`, not a boolean flag, despite a stale comment elsewhere suggesting
otherwise) reaches 256 total modifications, `costMultiplier` would need to double past `2^255`,
overflowing `uint256` under Solidity 0.8's default checked arithmetic — the ship becomes
permanently unmodifiable via `DroneYard`, forever, with no recovery path.

**Not practically reachable**: the exponential cost curve means `totalModifications ≈ 80-100`
already costs more UTC than any realistic token supply could fund, long before 256. Confirmed no
free/repeatable path exists to increment `shipData.modified` outside the paid `modifyShip` flow.

**Fix (cheap insurance, not urgent):** add a defensive cap, or switch the loop to a bit-shift
(`1 << totalModifications`, same result, no realistic revert risk at these magnitudes either, but
marginally cheaper and no worse) as belt-and-suspenders.

## Informational

### ~~ECON-01 — `Ships.purchaseWithFlow`'s FLOW-Denominated Referral, Stacked With `shipBreaker` Recycling, Extracts Real Protocol Revenue~~

**Reassessed 2026-09-16, after discussion with the project owner — not an exploit.** The
mechanism below was verified accurately (including with a real on-chain PoC), but the original
conclusion was wrong. See "Corrected understanding" at the end of this entry; the original
write-up is kept intact above it for the record, per this repo's documentation convention.

**File:** `contracts/Ships.sol` — `purchaseWithFlow` (149-176), `_processReferral` (532-560),
`shipBreaker` (736-...); `contracts/ShipPurchaser.sol` — `purchaseUTCWithFlow` (91-107, the
protocol's own documented UTC/native-token peg definition)

**Distinct from the already-reviewed-and-accepted `pre-audit.md` L-07** (self-referral on
`ShipPurchaser`'s UTC-denominated path — harmless, since the referral payout there comes out of
the *same currency* being distributed, bounding it to a discount that nets to a wash). This
finding is a different mechanism: `Ships.sol` has its *own*, separate `_processReferral`, paid in
**real native FLOW**, on a purchase path whose product (ships) can be immediately converted back
into UTC at a protocol-defined 1:1 peg via recycling — and unlike `ShipPurchaser`'s UTC-side
referral, nothing discounts the recycled side to compensate.

**The peg, confirmed directly from source:** `ShipPurchaser.purchaseUTCWithFlow`'s own comment
states it plainly — `"Mint the UTC equivalent of buying + recycling this tier's ship pack"` —
and mints `tierShips[_tier] * ships.recycleReward()` UTC for exactly `tierPrices[_tier]` FLOW.
This is the protocol's explicit, intentional definition: `tierShips[tier] * recycleReward` UTC
**is** worth `tierPrices[tier]` FLOW. Buying a tier's ships via `Ships.purchaseWithFlow` and then
recycling all of them via `shipBreaker` reaches this exact same peg by an alternate route — on
its own, a break-even loop, not a bug (an intentional alternate on-ramp, not exploitable by
itself).

**The exploit — verified line-by-line, not just trusted:**
- `Ships.purchaseWithFlow(_to, tier, _referral, variant)` requires `msg.value ==
  tierPrices[_tier]` (real FLOW), mints `tierShips[tier]` ships, then — since (unlike
  `purchaseUTCWithFlow`) this function *does* accept a `_referral` address — calls
  `_processReferral(_referral, totalShips, tierPrices[_tier])`.
- `_processReferral` pays `payable(_referrer).call{value: referralAmount}("")` where
  `referralAmount = (_salePrice * referralPercentage) / 100` — **real FLOW**, not UTC.
  `referralPercentage` scales with the referrer's cumulative `referralCount` (hardcoded tiers:
  0% under 1,000, 10% at 1,000+, 20% at 10,000+, 35% at 50,000+, 50% at 100,000+).
- `shipBreaker` mints `recycleReward` (0.1 UTC default) per non-previously-destroyed ship burned,
  **completely independent of what was paid for the ship** — no check for discount, referral, or
  purchase price at all (the only gate is `isFreeShip`, which correctly blocks the *unrelated*
  free-claim paths, but does nothing here since `purchaseWithFlow`-minted ships aren't free
  ships).

**Worked numbers:** self-refer (or use a second address you also control — this doesn't require
defeating Sybil resistance, which this project's own design notes already treat as infeasible
on-chain). Pay `P = tierPrices[tier]` FLOW. Same transaction, receive back `R = P *
pct/100` FLOW. Net FLOW outlay: `P*(1 - pct/100)`. Recycle all minted ships: receive UTC worth,
by the protocol's own peg, exactly `P` FLOW-equivalent. **Profit per cycle: `P * pct/100`,
funded directly out of `Ships.sol`'s FLOW balance** — the same balance `withdraw()` (owner-only)
expects to be genuine sale revenue. At the 10% tier (reachable after ~1,000 cumulative referred
ships — attainable with ordinary repeated purchases, no special privilege) every cycle nets 10%
of the tier price back as pure profit; at the 50% tier, nearly double. Fully repeatable, no
per-transaction cap beyond the tier price itself.

**Why this isn't just "another instance of L-07":** L-07's self-referral is economically inert
because the payout and the thing being discounted are the *same currency* (UTC), so a self-payer
is just moving their own money in a circle. Here the referral is paid in FLOW while the
recyclable product (UTC, via the ships) is untouched by the discount — the two don't net against
each other, so the referral is uncompensated, real, extractable value every single cycle.

**Fix candidates considered at the time (kept for the record — none were needed; see "Corrected
understanding" below):**
1. Require `_referral != msg.sender` / `_referral != _to` — closes literal self-referral but not
   collusion via a second address (the same actor controls both) — likely insufficient alone.
2. Switch `Ships.sol`'s referral to be UTC-denominated (deducted from/capped by the recyclable
   value), matching `ShipPurchaser`'s already-safe L-07 pattern — closes the arbitrage at the
   root, but is a real behavior change (referrers currently expect a FLOW payout).
3. Prevent (or claw back / time-lock) recycling for ships minted via a referred purchase — targets
   the actual buy→recycle cycle directly, but adds real state-tracking complexity.
4. Cap `referralAmount` relative to `tierShips[tier] * recycleReward`'s FLOW-equivalent value —
   reduces the margin but doesn't eliminate it (any nonzero referral still leaves *some*
   uncompensated profit, per the math above).

**Corrected understanding (2026-09-16), after discussion with the project owner:**

The native-token-denominated self-referral is an accepted, by-design cost of the referral
program — not itself a bug. The relevant question is only whether stacking it with recycling lets
a player exceed the referral program's own bound, and it doesn't: `referralPercentages` hard-caps
at 50% (the array has no higher tier), and `recycleReward` is a flat, purchase-price-independent
constant, so the combination can't be leveraged past that ceiling. Effective UTC-minting cost via
this route ranges from the full peg (`tierPrice / (tierShips * recycleReward)`, ≈8.33
native-token per UTC at tier 4, 0% referral) down to exactly half that (≈4.17 native-token per
UTC) at the maxed-out 50% referral tier — never lower.

Once a liquid UTC market exists (e.g. the planned Uniswap v4 lottery pool, seeded from this same
peg), this becomes a supply-side arbitrage rather than a direct drain: mint UTC at the discounted
cost, sell it on the market, repeat. As long as market price sits above the arbitrageur's mint
cost, this keeps adding sell-side supply and pushes market price down; it stops being profitable
once market price reaches the mint-cost floor. With referral-tier access unrestricted (anyone can
ramp their own `referralCount` up with ordinary repeated purchases — no Sybil resistance needed or
assumed to exist here), that floor converges toward roughly 50% of the peg's full price, matching
the project owner's own economic model. This is expected, self-limiting market behavior, not an
uncapped extraction — there's no fix needed here.

Checked for a cheaper alternative floor before accepting this: free ships
(`FreeShipClaim`/`TutorialClaim`) cannot be recycled at all (`Ships.sol`'s `shipBreaker` reverts
with `CannotRecycleFreeShip` on `isFreeShip` ships) — so the 50%-off self-referral purchase really
is the cheapest way to obtain a recyclable ship; nothing pushes the floor lower. Also confirmed
the "UTC only ever enters the economy via a native-token-backed purchase" premise holds even
through combat kills: `ShipsRouter.setTimestampDestroyed` pays a killer `recycleReward >> 2` (25%)
via `DestroyRewardLib`, and if the original owner later recycles that same now-destroyed ship,
`shipBreaker` only pays them `recycleReward >> 1` (50%) — 75% total, split between killer and
owner, never more than one clean recycle (100%) would have paid. No new/free UTC source, just a
redistribution of one purchase's backing.

**Residual item spun out of this analysis, since closed:** an earlier pass of this section flagged
`ShipPurchaser.purchaseWithUC`'s pricing as inconsistent with this mint peg (tracked as ECON-06).
That comparison used the wrong benchmark — see ECON-06 under "Reviewed, no issue found" for the
corrected analysis.

### ~~ECON-03 — `VariantPurchaseGate` Only Enforces at Mint Time, Not on Transfer~~

**Confirmed intentional by the project owner, 2026-09-16 — left as is, no change needed.**

**File:** `contracts/VariantPurchaseGate.sol`; `contracts/Ships.sol:508` (`checkGate` called only
from `_mintShip`)

Standard, common NFT-gated-mint behavior (gate at mint, freely tradeable after) and very likely
intentional — flagged only because `DroneYard.sol`'s own comment on `_validateShip` explicitly
frames "closing the buy-cheap-then-convert bypass around variant purchase gates... at the root"
as a deliberate design goal, suggesting the project cares about this gate's integrity beyond just
mint-time. Worth an explicit design confirmation (matching how other accepted-intentional items
are tracked in `audit-2.md`), not a fix by default.

Confirmed: the gate is meant to restrict who can *mint* a gated variant, not who can *own* one
afterward — ordinary secondary-market resale of an already-minted gated-variant ship to a
non-holder is expected behavior, same as most NFT-holder-gated mints. `DroneYard`'s
variant-immutability guard closes a different bypass (minting around the gate indirectly via
modification) and doesn't imply transfer-time enforcement was also intended.

### ~~ECON-04 — Stale "(soulbound)" Comment in `DestroyRewardLib.sol` Contradicts DEC's Actual, Intentional Design~~

**Fixed 2026-09-16** — removed the stale "(soulbound)" word from the comment at
`contracts/DestroyRewardLib.sol:21`. Doc-only change, no behavior affected.

**File:** `contracts/DestroyRewardLib.sol:20`

`DroneEnergyCores.sol`'s own header comment states DEC is "Deliberately not soulbound: a player
who has time but not money can grind DEC and sell it" — matching the project's actual intended
design (see also this session's memory notes on the DEC economy design). The word "(soulbound)"
in `DestroyRewardLib`'s comment is stale/wrong documentation, not a behavior bug — the actual
mint call and token contract are correct. One-line doc fix, not a code fix.

### ECON-05 — Collusive Free-Ship Kill-Farming Nets a Small, Already-Bounded UTC Reward

**File:** `contracts/FreeShipClaim.sol`, `contracts/DestroyRewardLib.sol`

Two Sybil-controlled accounts can each claim free ships (`FreeShipClaim.claimFreeShips`, 10 free
ships, no cost beyond gas), use their one free `Lobbies.createLobby` game each, and have one
side's ships kill the other's uncontested for `DestroyRewardLib`'s flat `recycleReward >> 2`
(0.025 UTC) per kill — up to 10 kills = 0.25 UTC for near-zero real cost. Not a serious drain:
free ships can't be recycled (`CannotRecycleFreeShip`), the per-kill rate is tiny, and any
*repeat* game costs real FLOW (`additionalLobbyFee`) that almost certainly exceeds the reward.
Noted since it's a real, previously-undocumented path, even though the value is negligible.

## Reviewed, no issue found

- **`ShipPurchaser.purchaseUTCWithFlow`** — its mint formula is exactly the protocol's own peg
  definition, not exploitable against itself; it takes no referral parameter at all, so ECON-01's
  mechanism can't occur on this path directly.
- **ECON-06 — `ShipPurchaser.purchaseWithUC`'s pricing** (originally flagged, then reassessed —
  see `contracts/ShipPurchaser.sol` `purchaseWithUC` 54-81, `Ships.sol` `recycleReward` 88) — an
  earlier pass compared `purchaseWithUC`'s price table against `purchaseUTCWithFlow`'s mint peg
  and flagged a mismatch. That was the wrong benchmark: the mint peg is calibrated to mirror
  recycling's own rate (its doc comment says so directly), and recycling is *intentionally* a
  lossy "dust" mechanic by design — a player recycling 10 unwanted ships should net roughly enough
  UTC for 1 new ship, the same shape as disenchant/shard systems in gacha-style games, not a
  break-even round trip. Checked `purchaseWithUC` against that actual target instead
  (`recycleReward` = 0.1 UTC/ship flat): tier 0 (5 ships / 4.99 UC) works out to 0.998 UTC/ship,
  a ~9.98:1 ratio against the 0.1 UTC/ship recycle rate — almost exactly the intended 10:1.
  Larger tiers drift toward ~8.3:1 (tier 4: 60 ships / 49.99 UC = 0.833 UTC/ship), a mild,
  consistent bulk discount for buying bigger packs — standard store/gacha pricing shape, not a
  miscalibration. Also re-checked the exploit-safety question under this corrected framing
  (native-token → UTC via `purchaseUTCWithFlow` → ships via `purchaseWithUC`, compared to buying
  ships directly): still not exploitable, and by a wider margin than the original (wrong-benchmark)
  analysis suggested — routing through UTC this way costs roughly 5-20x more per ship than buying
  directly, even at ECON-01's ~50%-referral floor. Current pricing needs no change.
- **DEC/UTC currency-routing** — `DestroyRewardLib.payDestroyReward` routes by checking whether
  the *destroyed* ship's owner is a registered single-player orchestrator
  (`ILobbiesOrchestratorCheck.isSinglePlayerOrchestrator`). AI-ship ownership is fixed at
  allocation time and can't be spoofed by a player, so there's no path to redirect an AI-kill
  reward from DEC into the more valuable UTC.
- **`Ships.sol` cost-versioning** (`_mintShip`/`calculateShipCost`) — already hardened by the
  fixed H-01/M-01 (version-increment-then-overwrite bug). No new gap found.
- **`GenerateNewShip.sol`** — pure/deterministic trait generation, no state, no value-flow
  surface.
- **`DECBonusWinEffect.sol`/`ShipGrantWinEffect.sol`/`HealAboveFloorWinEffect.sol`** — each gated
  to its configured caller only (Tournament/PvPMatch/RoguelikeMatch's win-effect dispatch); no
  direct player-callable mint path.
- **`TutorialClaim.sol`** — same shape as `FreeShipClaim`, one-time per address, free ships
  non-recyclable; no new farming path.
- **`DroneStorefront.sol`** — burns via `burnFrom` (real allowance-gated burn, not bypassable).
- **`UniversalCredits.sol`** — clean owner-gated mint infrastructure; economic risk lives in which
  contracts are authorized and their own logic (covered above), not in this contract itself.
- **`Tournament.finalize()`'s 60/40-minus-1%-fee split** — verified with real numbers: for a 100
  ETH pool, `fee=1`, `remainder=99`, `second=(99*40)/100=39` (truncated), `first=99-39=60`. Sums
  to exactly 100, integer-division dust correctly flows to the champion, never lost or
  double-counted. `claim()`/`finalize()` both use correct checks-effects-interactions ordering.
- **`UTCLotteryHook`'s entry-qualifying mechanism** (distinct angle from the already-fixed
  HA2-06, which covered win-probability gaming) — `ethProceeds` is the PoolManager's real,
  enforced settlement delta, not user-suppliable data; no way to "look like" a qualifying sell
  without actually paying the corresponding real UTC input and the pool's real fee both
  directions. `hookData`'s free-form trader-attribution can misdirect lottery weight to a third
  party but never for the misattributor's own profit.
- **`Lobbies`' `freeGamesPerAddress`/`additionalLobbyFee`** — measures *concurrent* active
  lobbies, not lifetime games; a player who finishes one lobby before starting the next never
  pays the fee, by design — correct, not a bypass.
- **`ShipAttributes.setCosts`/cost-versioning** — always derives the new version from current
  on-chain storage, ignoring any caller-supplied version (already hardened per H-01/M-01);
  `calculateShipCost` is a pure live read with no staleness desync against the separate
  attributes-versioning system.
- **`DroneEnergyCores.sol`** — a straightforward `authorizedToMint`-gated ERC20 with no pricing
  logic of its own.
